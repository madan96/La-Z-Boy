# La-Z-Boy

The end result of extreme boredom and the sufferings after watching some really low-rated movies on TV.

This package is really helpful when you want to know the the Movies that are to be telecasted on TV
along with their `"Timing"` and `"IMDb Rating"`, so you never miss out a good watch right when you sit
on your La-Z-Boy.
